          Hi there! I'm <b>cold</b>. I like computers whether hard or soft. This
          means hardware and software. Right now, I study at the <Link
            href="https://www.bergen.org/bergencountyacademies"
            external>Bergen County Academies</Link
          >. You may see me solving CTF challenges or doing other stuff like
          coding or problem solving.
