notes: |
  - Tien did most here. We kinda started doing this after all the Deadsec challs (at the same time) were too hard for us/we thought we were cooked
  - I used Gemini for a very large amount of challs and it solved a lot. Thanks Gemini. At the time of writing (08/31/25) i am still excited for Gemini 3.0 pro.
  - There was a lot of OSINT that i cooked on
  - Idk there was some Vibe Shell thing pretty unique concept
  - Im yapping here cuz the channel in Discord is still there so i can look back
