notes: |
  - I played with watermelon, yougotbonked, geo, tien maybe? i dont remember :(
  - I was in Boston at another event and had to play at night in a hotel. Pulled all-nighters. It hit different solving challenges alone at night in a hotel room ngl. Kinda a once in a few years experience for me.
  - Unfortunately couldn't do a simple MT19937 crack that is now trivial looking back
