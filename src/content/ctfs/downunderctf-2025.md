  - I did a lot of misc stuff + osint stuff at the beginning, mostly sniping easy challs like usual lmao. But at the end I was able to solve a forensics chall where you had limited byte reads of a random filesystem. I had the solvepath but some issue with the connection or smth was annoying so I gambled + OCR (flag was a jpg) and actually got the flag lmao
