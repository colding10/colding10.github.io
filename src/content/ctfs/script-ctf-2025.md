review: |
  A fun event overall. Rev challs were pretty light for the most part. Was mostly beginner-friendly so I sniped a lot of easy challs.
  Cheating accusations at the end were a bit too wild but admins dealt with it nicely.
quality: 8/10
wouldPlayAgain: yes

  - We full cleared everything except for the Blockchain; only UofT solved that one
  - Won a Hex-Rays t shirt, Hex-Rays notebook, HTB+ 1yr subscription, and 150/4 = 37.5 dollars
