review: |
  A fun event overall. Certainly on the harder side for me. But well made with quality challs for the most part.
quality: 9/10
wouldPlayAgain: yes
notes: |
  - Ngl I only did some easy rev then skillissued on boat_vm. At least I learned a lot about VM rev from working on boat_vm with DisplayGFX + dudcom. Also hopefully the part of dudcom's body that got injured (those who know) is better now lol
