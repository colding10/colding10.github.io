  Pretty good high school ctf, many challs were easy/cookiecutter but some were pretty good and we didn't even solve them
quality: 7/10
wouldPlayAgain: yes
notes: |
  - I kinda didn't play ctf at all this weekend (and i should have been doing hitcon mb), but for what it's worth i wasn't really doing LIT either tbh
  - Just vibe solved a few "hard" rev and gave up on everything else. Sniped easy challs with vibe skills again
