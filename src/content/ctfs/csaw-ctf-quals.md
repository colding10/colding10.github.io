  This isn't speaking about all of the challs, there were some okay / good ones. But overall it was shitty. Guessy challs, GUESSY AS IN HAVING TO LOOK UP RANDOM SHIT FOR "osint". Also random ass brute forcing for crypto. These guys might have filled every single square on the bingo. Also they delayed ctf 30m 1:00 then one day after dropping challs and smth. Fuckass chall quality and organiation. Admins lowk kinda ragebaiting too with the "complain to modmail".

    Fuck this AI ass shitty description "riddle" "OSINT ðŸ¤“ " type chall
quality: 2/10
wouldPlayAgain: no

  - At least SPL full cleared.
