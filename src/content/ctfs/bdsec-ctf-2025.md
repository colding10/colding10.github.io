review: |
  I played this ctf while travelling/on the plane so was kind of half-assed. I remember brute forcing stuff on the plane and getting flag lmao. This time we played with fuller BCA which includes other ppl like bz421 + snippetcat.

  Some challs were kind of low quality tho imo and a lot of unclear things. Too much brute forcing and ambiguity.
quality: 5/10
wouldPlayAgain: no

  - We placed top 15 or something so we won a shirt but we have to be in Mumbai to get it so :(
