# Introduction

This CTF was one of the first CTFs I played with my high school team [Bing Chilling Academies](https://ctftime.org/team/283028). Such, it holds a couple of fond memories for me.

Btw, @tien still owes me a Brawl Pass.

## Scrambled Packets

> I accidentally broke my message and it got all mixed up with everything else. Can you help me get it back?

Loading the given pcap in wireshark to see that there are a lot of **ICMP** pings.
looking through a few of them, we see that some of them have sussy **1 byte data** so we extract those using `tshark`, and realize that its junk :(.

lmao it was scrambled, so we sort it by **sequence number** using this command:
```bash
tshark -r cap.pcap -Y "icmp && data.len == 1" -T fields -e icmp.seq -e data | sort -n -k1
```

And we get the flag: `TexSAW{not_the_fake_one}`
