# The beginning

Today is a very auspcious day. It is 08/08. Also, it is the day that I begin this new blog. Hopefully you can find some interesting stuff on here and maybe learn a thing or two :)

## What this will look like soon

I'll probably migrate over some writeups from [my CTF team site](https://bingchillingacademies.vercel.app) in the following few days.

It is quite cursed since they will be from before this timepoint. Gonna figure out how to deal with that.

And maybe write up a few reverse engineering challenges that I solved recently.

## A note on the writeups

Writeups after the ones that can be found on  [my CTF team site](https://bingchillingacademies.vercel.app) will probably be better quality. Also, I'm not including every single one/every single challenge I solved here. Just the fun ones and/or the ones I liked.

**Note/disclamer:** i know i should include challenge source when i reference it, but im really too lazy to do so. mb

## Cheers!

I hope you have fun reading and hopefully gain something (be it a laugh or a piece of information) from this site!
