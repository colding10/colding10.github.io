# The beginning

Today is a very auspcious day. It is 08/08. Also, it is the day that I begin this new blog. Hopefully you can find some interesting stuff on here and maybe learn a thing or two :)

## What this will look like soon

I'll probably migrate over some writeups from [my CTF team site](https://bingchillingacademies.vercel.app) in the following few days.

And maybe write up a few reverse engineering challenges that I solved recently.
