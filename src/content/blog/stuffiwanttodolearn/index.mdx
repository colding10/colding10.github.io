# Introduction

so i am a pretty young person with a lot of things that i want to learn or do one day. here is a list so that in the future i can look back at it and either feel happy or disappointed in myself :).

## Stuff I want to learn

### (neo)vim

So I do already use `nvim` as my "daily driver" but i want to get better with non-basic things like registers, Visual Mode (ts scary) and other stuff like macros and things.

like i see ppl doing magic like writing out lists with substitutions and things that i want to get good at. i feel like its helpful since i do do a lot of writing in LaTeX for example and other stuff like markdown so being able to maniuplate text really quickly is one of my skills that I want to gain

### Zig

I want to get better at low/ish level programming and i know C and Zig seems like a better version of C ngl. The syntax also seems "fun to use".

### Rust

it seems like everybody uses rust these days. i should become a cool kid and learn how to use rust

### Fuzzing

afl / libfuzzer are rlly cool and i want to learn

## Stuff I want to do

### travel somewhere for an inperson CTF

like every single one i do is online or travelling within state (that one time), id be cool to go somewhere
